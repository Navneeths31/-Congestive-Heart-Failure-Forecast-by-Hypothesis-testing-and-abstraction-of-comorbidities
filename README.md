Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a chronic progressive ailment that affects the impelling force exerted by heart muscles. While often mentioned simply as heart failure, CHF specifically refers to the phase in which water shapes round the heart and makes it pump unproductively. Hypothesis testing is a statistical technique which is used in creating statistical conclusions using experimental data.  Hypothesis Testing is essentially a postulation that we make about the population parameter. In this study, we see the outcome of Hypothesis Testing on a given data and see whether we reject or accept the Null or Alternate Hypothesis. The statistics for this study was taken from the BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database, Health-Data and from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States. We apply Hypothesis Testing on these data by associating the average of the features with the p-value of each of the features and check if they satisfy the 95% confidence interval. Studentâ€™s t-test Hypothesis Testing method was chosen. We see that all the features accepted the Null Hypothesis that is, none of them satisfy the 95% confidence limit. Along with that, a list of comorbidities existing in the data were also found.
